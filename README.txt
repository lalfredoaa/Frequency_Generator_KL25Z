Final project of Microcontrollers course (5th semester). 

Implementation of a frequency generator using KL25Z microcontroller. 

The circuit included 2 potentiometers to control wave frequency and amplitude. 

The used could change the waveform to square, triangle or sine. 

There were power/off buttons. 

Some LEDs indicated if the amplification reached a certain saturation threshold.
